WORKLOG OF PROJECT in 
   1dv437 - Introduction to Game Programming
   
24/6 17:
Created git repo and work-log, planning doc. Added some milestones. 
Finished milestones 1-7. 

25/6 17:
Learned a little about bezier curves. Made demon objects move. Both
with animation and with script. The script constatly updates the player
position and lerps towards it. (REALLY SCARY!) 
TODO: Spawn the demon at some random position. 
IDEA: Spawn demons with varying speed. Enable several to be alive at the
same time. PROBLEM: Collisions between demons??? Have on stop and move
slightly aside? (will resolve nicely if different speed right?)
