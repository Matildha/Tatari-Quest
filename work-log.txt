WORKLOG OF PROJECT in 
   1dv437 - Introduction to Game Programming
   
24/6 17:
Created git repo and work-log, planning doc. Added some milestones. 
Finished milestones 1-7. 

25/6 17:
Learned a little about bezier curves. Made demon objects move. Both
with animation and with script. The script constatly updates the player
position and lerps towards it. (REALLY SCARY!) 
TODO: Spawn the demon at some random position. 
IDEA: Spawn demons with varying speed. Enable several to be alive at the
same time. PROBLEM: Collisions between demons??? Have on stop and move
slightly aside? (will resolve nicely if different speed right?)

26/6 17:
Experimented with bezier curves and collision dodging algorithms for 
demons. I DON'T think we will make demons able to dodge objects like walls.
But possibly we can make them avoid other demons like explained above.
But we shouldn't prioritize it until later. 
IDEA: Have fized control points for bezier curves in each corridor/room.
Let the demon find the corridor/room and the associated control points
in it. 

3/7 17:
TODO: Make InteractableManager a singelton. EDIT: Maybe not... 
   Managed to implement walking up to a scroll, being prompted to press
a button and then succesfully interacting with it. Yay! 
   Scrolls now disappear when being picked up. (destroyed) Info is
transferred to player inventory. NOTE: This might currently cause a
problem with the struct just being a reference or something!! 

Created a file to read from in ScrollFactory, to store all symptom
combinations in.

4/7 17:
Fixed some problems that occured when removing interactables. Everything
should be working now! 
   Created basic graphical displaying for interaction prompts and scroll 
content.
   Implemented moving of one door.
   Created the demon spawner class. Created an algorithm for increasing chance
of demon spawn while the player has the lantern lit.

5/7 17:
Addded things to WorldManager and continuted with the demon spawn. Demons can
now spawn on random start position and being either homing or not. Demon spawn
gets demon control points from WorldManager. 

7/7 17:
Implemented thresholds ans switching between world areas. 

8/7 17:
Need to handle areas that does not have any scroll or victim positions. DONE!

10/7 17:
TODO: Glimmer animation on bars

TODO: Make demons target player front

TODO: Determine whether it is necessary to deactivate interactables

IDEA: Kanji for color on scrolls  OK 

11/7 17:
TODO: Show infobox in beginning explaining space to switch light. 
TODO: Enable/Disable tips in start menu.

Created an infobox that can be used in various situations. For example as tips
and when interacting with victim. With bool to set in player script for now.
   Also created a difference of reading and chanting a scroll. Player chants a 
scroll if interactable in range is a victim and this takes longer time then
normal reading obviously. 
   Created the most AWESOME looking shouji panels ever. :D 
TODO: Something weird is going on with the lantern light. I think we need to
research more about unity lights. But this is not priority right now. 
   ANNNNIIIMATED a hurt effect when hit by demon. Took some time but looks fine
now.

12/7 17:

Did a blueprint of house with marked world areas. We can cut off the bottom
part if we for some reason would not be able to fix potential performance issues.

13/7 17:
IDEA: Quads with bloodsplash images on floor!

14/7 17:
Created window panel. A0-A11 with exception on A8 are set up with walls, floor
(no texture) and doors. 
THINK ABOUT: Whether player be able to rotate (use mouse movement) while reading.
Placed demon control points and scroll spawn positions in A0-A11 (including A8).
Placed victim spawn positions and set max victims to 4. 

Changed tag of player hitbox, since it caused incorrect triggers of thresholds.
Added step sound to player. Which softens as you go on to tatami rooms.

BUG-ALERT: READING a scroll and then turning to a victim causes it to CHANT!
(or at least channel bar to restart!!)  Fixed

16/7 17:
BE WARY OF: Unable to interact with victim?? Why does this happen??!!!
TODO: See if you can do something about demons spawning inside the player
hitbox.     Did an easy fix with decreasing hitbox. 

17/7 17:
IDEA: Animation of shadow in shouji wall. 
IDEA: Bow thank you animation for saved victim. (player face the other way 
when victim disappears)
IDEA: Make lantern emission effect "waver" up and down in intensity.  OK

23/7 17:
IDEA: Display time in success game over screen. (how long it took)  OK

24/7 17: 
TODO: Clearn up player update function (only getkeydown)

26// 17:
TODO: Disable intManager update when puasing. OK

27/7 17:
Make sure we don't depend on start execution order!! 
"Be careful, the demons are attracted to light.
 So don't keep it on for too long!"
 TODO: Make sure pausing the game when attacked by demon doesn't 
 result in not taking damage!
